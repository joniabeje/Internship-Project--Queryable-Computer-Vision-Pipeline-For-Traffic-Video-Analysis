# Queryable Computer Vision Pipeline for Traffic Video Analysis
This project demonstrates the development of a sophisticated computer vision system for monitoring traffic violations such as jaywalking and red-light running. Built using YOLO models, OpenCV, and SQL, the pipeline leverages real-time video analysis to improve traffic safety.


## Project Summary 
This project integrates deep learning models and computer vision techniques to detect and track traffic violations in real-time. The system utilizes YOLO models for object detection, OpenCV for processing, and MySQL for managing data. It also employs HSV for accurate traffic light state detection under various conditions.


## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in detecting traffic violations with minimal false positives.
- Integrated a robust SQL database to validate and analyze detected incidents.
