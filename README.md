# Internship-Project--Queryable-Computer-Vision-Pipeline-For-Traffic-Video-Analysis
This project demonstrates the development of a sophisticated computer vision system for monitoring traffic violations such as jaywalking and red-light running. Built using YOLO models, OpenCV, and SQL, the pipeline leverages real-time video analysis to improve traffic safety.
